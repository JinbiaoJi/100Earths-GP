goals from March 22 meeting

      - compare our GP realizations' chi^2 (per free parameter) to Angalada-Escude's model

      	chi^2 = [ SUM(i=1:N){ (y(i) - m(i))^2 } / sigma(i)^2 ] / (N-#pars-1)
	- y = data
	- m = model
	- sigma = uncertainty


      - Do we need a correlated noise model?
      - Begin work on Latex journal
      - Compare joint quasiperiodic with joint H-alpha longterm
      	- Likelihood ratios
	- BICS
