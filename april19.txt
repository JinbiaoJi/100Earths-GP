Goals from April 19th meeting:

- Use Systemic for find chi^2 for Anglada-Escude et al.'s model
  - create .sys and .vels files
  - add planet parameters
  - will calculate chi^2 for you
  
- Experiment with Period and Gamma RV priors

- ipython fitting of Anglada-Escude et al.'s model
  - double check for correct units
  - mess around with it, something isn't quite right
