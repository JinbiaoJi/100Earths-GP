Goals/To-Do's set during March 6 meeting. Feel free to add, remove, add, claim, etc...

Notes:
Convergence - almost there for the 8 parameter model (quasiperiodic in RV, quasiperiodic + long-term exponential in H-alpha)
For now, ignore the complex models. We will return to them if needed.

- Go back to original notebook with just RV
  - plot multiple samples individually
  - are they hitting the data points?

- Long-term exponential drift notebooks on RV and H-Alpha with NO periodicity
  - how well do we reproduce long-term trend?
  - do we converge? are posteriors well-behaved?

- Check george documentation for error method/variable to force a tighter fit on the real data

- Experiment with the minimizer technique

- Experiment with the noise
  - Do we want a uniform white noise?
  - Red noise - augment error bars (example done in george/emcee tutorial)

- Check george documentation on how to freeze parts of the kernel

From george documentation:
"Another feature common to the kernels is that you can "freeze" and "thaw" parameters by name"
k = [your kernel]
k.freeze_parameter([parameter name])
k.freeze_all_parameters()
k.thaw_parameter([parameter name])
k.thaw_all_parameters()

- Check sum of residuals for simple and complex models
