###################################################################

Background information
 - old m1 sub-dwarf
 - ~3.91 pc from the Sun (12.76 light years from Earth)
 - closest halo star to the solar system
   - halo stars
     - low luminosity
     - generally old, >12 billion years
     - generally metal poor

 - reported planets
   - two super-earth planets: Anglada-Escude (2014)
     - Kapteyn b, P = 48.6 days
       - in Kapteyn's "Goldilocks Zone"

     - Kapteyn b, P = 121.5 days

 - Debate
   - Robertson et. al (2015)
     - claimed stellar rotation: P = 143.days
     - 48 day period is an integer fraction (1/3) fo the stellar rotation -> due to rotation and activity
     - 121 day period is very close the rotation
       - need to observe Kapteyn more to come to a conclusion about planet c


 - Gaussian Processes
   - Last Semester
     - fitting quasiperioidc to just RV signals
     - kernel: periodic * squaredexponential
       - rotation period = 109.5 days
       - no significant signals in residuals
       	 - P = 17.8 days (from window function?)


   - This Semester
     - addition of H-alpha data
       - good indicator for magnetic activity
       - should help in establishing a rotation period of the star
       - modeling RV and H-alpha together
       	 - require that the periods and decorrelation timescales of the two be the same

     - model options
       - quasiperiodic only
       - quasiperiodic in RV, quasiperiodic with a longterm trend in H-Alpha
       - quasiperiodic with longterm trends in both RV and H-Alpha
       	 - metrics for longterm do NOT have to be the same
	 - metric for longterm DO have to be the same
	 - (these models are extremely fragile and dependent on initial guesses)


      - whitenoise
      	- include in compute() commands
	  - compute(alldates, allRVerr)
	  - remove call to whitenoise() function



  - Unknowns
    - limited data points
      - ~150 points over 10 years
      - Are there enough data points to report planets? Are there enough data points to be confident in the period?
