Goals moving forward from Friday, March 15 meeting:

 - pulling in the priors for the quasiperiodic RV model
 - continue experimentation with the different minimization techniques/algorithms
 - continue working on the convergence for quasiperiodic RV and quasiperiodic RV & H-alpha with long-term in H-alpha
 - summarize what we know so far about Kapteyn's star
 - abstract by Monday
   - look at/reference other AAS abstracts
